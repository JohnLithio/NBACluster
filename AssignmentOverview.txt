For two datasets:
    - Why are they interesting?
    Part 1:
        - EM
        - K-means
            + How did I choose K?
        - For each method:
            + Describe the kind of clusters
            + Do the clusters make sense?
            + Do the clusters line up with the labels?
                * Why or why not?
            + Compare/contrast the algorithms
            + What sort of changes could be made to the algorithms?
            + How much performance was due to problems chosen?
    Part 2:
        - PCA
			+ Weight attributes so that offense is equal to defense
            + Distribution of eigenvalues
            + How well is the data reconstructed?
        - ICA
            + How kurtotic are the distributions?
            + Do the projection axes capture anything meaningful?
        - Randomized Projection
            + Assuming I do dimensionality reduction, how well is the data reconstructed?
            + How much variation when re-ran several times?
        - Something else
    Part 3:
        - EM for Part 2
        - K-means for Part 2
            + How did I choose K?
        - Same clusters as Part 1?
            + Why/why not?

For dataset from Assignment 1:
    Part 4:
        - PCA + NN
            + Distribution of eigenvalues
            + How well is the data reconstructed?
        - ICA + NN
            + How kurtotic are the distributions?
            + Do the projection axes capture anything meaningful?
        - Randomized Projection + NN
            + Assuming I do dimensionality reduction, how well is the data reconstructed?
            + How much variation when re-ran several times?
        - Something else + NN
    Part 5:
        - EM + NN
        - K-means + NN
            + How did I choose K?
        - For each method:
            + Describe the kind of clusters
            + Do the clusters make sense?
            + Do the clusters line up with the labels?
                * Why or why not?
            + Compare/contrast the algorithms
            + What sort of changes could be made to the algorithms?
            + How much performance was due to problems chosen?
    Any differences in NN performance compared to first assignment? Speed? Other?

Graphs/Visuals:
    - K-means
        + Elbow
        + Distribution of positions in each group
        + Average stats for each group
        + Players closest to each centroid
    - EM
        + Distribution of positions in each group
        + Average stats for each group
        + Players closest to each centroid
        + Overlap with K-means groups
    - PCA
        + Distribution of eigenvalues
